# JustCleaner
Simple Windows cleanup utility. LOL

The script removes:

- Windows\\Logs\CBS\\\*.\* (sometimes may be VERY large)
- Windows\\Installer\\\*.MSI|.MSP (some of them which are not in the Windows Installer database; moves to the Recycle Bin)
- Windows\\Downloaded Installations
- Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download
- Windows\\Installer\\$PatchCache$\\Managed

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ;)
